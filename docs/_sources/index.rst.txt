Great Lakes Ice Climatology Tool Documentation
============================================================
The **Great Lakes Ice Climatology Tool** is a Python tool for visualizing and downloading ice climatology data. Utilizing data from the `Canadian Ice Service <https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/ice-forecasts-observations/latest-conditions/climatology/ice-climate-normals/great-lakes.html>`_, it offers a *simple* and
*intuitive* way to view and acquire 30-year climatology data for the Great Lakes.
